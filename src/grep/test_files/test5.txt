Romeo and Juliet 

But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
A plague o' both your houses!
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow
What's done is done, and there's no changing it
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon
These violent delights have violent ends
For never was a story of more woe
What's here? A cup, closed in my true love's hand?
O happy dagger! This is thy sheath
O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
For never was a tale of more woe
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast
Do not swear at all
Parting is such sweet sorrow
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do
This love feel I, that feel no love in this
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright
Love is a tender thing, a precious thing
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow
